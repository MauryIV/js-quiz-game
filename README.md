## Usage
Could be used to practice learning some simple JavaScript or just for fun!

## Roadmap
I want to fix the bug. The bug has something to do with the highscore button on the top left, if it is pressed after quiz starts, it will mess up the game.

## Contributing
I'd love some contribtions on how to fix the bug.
